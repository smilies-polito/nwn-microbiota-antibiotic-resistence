The present model design is implemented with the Renew 2.5 tool, downloaded from http://www.renew.de/ and installed on Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie).
It is possible to launch a simulation using the "simulation_run" file as the argument of the "script" command on the integrated command line of Renew, after selecting the "Java Net Compiler" formalism for the simulation. 
For the first experimental design, the simulation generates a file named "score_track.xls", where the resistance prevalence score is tracked and the system time associated with each sampling are reported.
